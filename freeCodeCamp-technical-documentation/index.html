                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
                <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code>&ltimg&gt</code> and <code>&ltinput/&gt</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

                <li>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
&lthtml&gt
  &lthead&gt
    &lttitle&gtThis is a title&lt/title&gt
  &lt/head&gt
  &ltbody&gt
    &ltdiv&gt
        &ltp&gtHello world!&lt/p&gt
    &lt/div&gt
  &lt/body&gt
&lt/html&gt
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting</p>

                <hr>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows the ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use. JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js, or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.</p>
                <p>Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java. Though the names of both languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations.</p>
                <li>In Java, to define a variable, you have to say what type of variable it is: a number, a word, a letter, or more. In JavaScript, this is not necessary. In JavaScript, functions are stored as variables (unlike Java). This makes the following code okay in JavaScript:</li>
                <pre>
                <code>
function sayHi() {
    alert("Hi!");
}

sayBye = function() {
    alert("Bye!");
}

sayHi();
sayBye()
                </code>
                </pre>
                <li>A minimalist Hello, world. in JavaSript:</li>
                <pre><code>
console.log("Hello World!");
                </code></pre>
